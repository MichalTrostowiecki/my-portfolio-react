					Transitioning from personal training into web development, I bring a unique blend of client-focused skills and technical expertise.
					My dedication to this new path is marked by completing an EDX Front-End Development Bootcamp,
					where I honed my abilities in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React.
					As an empathetic communicator and adaptable problem-solver,
					Iâ€™m seeking a developer role to apply my skills in a dynamic team,
					driving projects that combine innovative tech solutions with client-centered design.
					Eager to contribute and grow in a tech environment,
					I am ready to leverage my diverse background and training for impactful web development.
